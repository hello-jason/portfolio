I learned to hold CMD while dragging, which performs a move, but I was ecstatic to learn there are options when pasting a file. CMD+V pastes a copy, CMD+Option+V moves it.

The area around each circular button is dead space, reducing the target area that I can click (i.e., making it harder for me to click one of them). Also, the circle buttons are spaced away from the corner of the window, whereas the Windows button <strong>is the entire corner</strong>. Look at the picture. It's the entire corner.

My brain and fingers could not get comfortable with this. Windows keyboards have a backspace key to remove text behind the cursor, and a delete key to remove characters in front of the cursor.<br><br>Windows also lets you go back one page in the browser and Explorer by hitting the backspace key. I take advantage of this by setting a button on <a href="https://evoluent.com/">my mouse</a> to the Backspace key (instead of just Back), which lets me backspace and go back one page if my right hand is already on the mouse. I also use this mouse shortcut in Photoshop to delete layers, in Sublime to remove some lines, etc. Super handy.</p> </div> <div class=vs-screenshot> <img src='../../assets/images/articles/vs-evoluent-mouse.png'/> </div> </div> </div></div><div class=panel><div class=panel-heading><h2 class=panel-title>Section 3: User Interface</h2><p></p></div><div class=panel-body><div class="row window-snapping"> <div class=vs-score> <img class=icon-dichomoty src="../../assets/images/icon-check-circle.svg" alt="Good thing"/> <img class=logo-os src="../../assets/images/logo-windows-10.svg" alt=Windows /> </div> <div class="vs-description without-image"> <strong>Window snapping</strong> <p>The snapping feature on Windows has drastically increased my efficiency.

They even finely-tuned the sensitivity when you move a window towards the edge of a monitor that has another monitor next to it&ndash;you can snap it to the edge, or keep on dragging to bring it to the other screen. OS X users have a few options to get this feature, such as <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/bettersnaptool/id417375580">BetterSnapTool</a> (paid) or <a href="https://www.spectacleapp.com/">Spectacle</a> (free); they'll do the trick, but I found they are not quite as refined or as satisfying as Windows.</p> </div> </div> <div class="row multi-monitor-support"> <div class=vs-score> <img class=icon-dichomoty src="../../assets/images/icon-check-circle.svg" alt="Good thing"/> <img class=logo-os src="../../assets/images/logo-windows-10.svg" alt=Windows /> </div> <div class=vs-description> <strong>Multi-monitor support</strong> <p>Windows 10 has incredible support for multiple monitors; task bar options for each monitor, settings to show where apps are open. Also, individual programs can overflow across multiple monitors if you need something to be very wide; OS X just cuts it off if you try to do that.</p> </div> <div class=vs-screenshot> <img src='../../assets/images/articles/vs-multiple-monitors.png'/> </div> </div> <div class="row clicking-an-app-eats-the-first-click"> <div class=vs-score> <img class=icon-dichomoty src="../../assets/images/icon-times-circle.svg" alt="Bad thing"/> <img class=logo-os src="../../assets/images/logo-apple.svg" alt=Osx /> </div> <div class="vs-description without-image"> <strong>Clicking an app eats the first click</strong> <p>My workstation typically includes 3 monitors, which means I have a lot of windows open at the same time.

It also shows multiple thumbnails if there are several windows open for that app.</p> </div> <div class=vs-screenshot> <img src='../../assets/images/articles/vs-sneak-peak.png'/> </div> </div> <div class="row jump-lists--pinned-and-recent-items-"> <div class=vs-score> <img class=icon-dichomoty src="../../assets/images/icon-check-circle.svg" alt="Good thing"/> <img class=logo-os src="../../assets/images/logo-windows-10.svg" alt=Windows /> </div> <div class=vs-description> <strong>Jump lists (pinned and recent items)</strong> <p>This is a great feature. You can right click a program in your taskbar and see a list of recent, most visited, and pinned things for that program. It's often super convenient to open the program and the file right from your taskbar and with a single click.</p> </div> <div class=vs-screenshot> <img src='../../assets/images/articles/vs-jump-list.png'/> </div> </div> <div class="row single-menu-bar"> <div class=vs-score> <img class=icon-dichomoty src="../../assets/images/icon-times-circle.svg" alt="Bad thing"/> <img class=logo-os src="../../assets/images/logo-apple.svg" alt=Osx /> </div> <div class="vs-description without-image"> <strong>Single menu bar</strong> <p>Some people love it, but I can't stand it. A single menu bar to rule them all forces extra clicks and wasted time. Rather than seeing the menu item I want and clicking directly on it, OS X wants me to waste a click (or alt+tab) to make a program active first, then I can review the menu options for that program.</p> </div> </div> <div class="row cannot-have-dock-on-all-monitors"> <div class=vs-score> <img class=icon-dichomoty src="../../assets/images/icon-times-circle.svg" alt="Bad thing"/> <img class=logo-os src="../../assets/images/logo-apple.svg" alt=Osx /> </div> <div class="vs-description without-image"> <strong>Cannot have dock on all monitors</strong> <p>Related to the point above, a single menu bar becomes more annoying when working on multiple monitors, having to jump back to the primary monitor to interact with menu items. And you can only have the menu on a single monitor at a time, which is not very helpful to me.</p> </div> </div> <div class="row clicking-an-icon-in-the-dock-does-not-maximize-minimize-that-application"> <div class=vs-score> <img class=icon-dichomoty src="../../assets/images/icon-times-circle.svg" alt="Bad thing"/> <img class=logo-os src="../../assets/images/logo-apple.svg" alt=Osx /> </div> <div class="vs-description without-image"> <strong>Clicking an icon in the dock does not maximize/minimize that application</strong> <p>OS X ignores my feeble attempts to minimize a program by clicking its icon in the dock. Windows lets you click an open application's taskbar icon (in the "dock") to minimize and maximize that program.</p> </div> </div> <div class="row cannot-cmd-tab-to-switch-to-minimized-apps"> <div class=vs-score> <img class=icon-dichomoty src="../../assets/images/icon-times-circle.svg" alt="Bad thing"/> <img class=logo-os src="../../assets/images/logo-apple.svg" alt=Osx /> </div> <div class="vs-description without-image"> <strong>Cannot CMD+tab to switch to minimized apps</strong> <p>Minimizing an application in OS X tosses it to the right side of the dock and kills my ability to use CMD+tab to switch to and maximize that app. There is an option to have apps minimize into their icon (rather than to the side) but things get wonky when you have multiple windows of the same app open.<br><br>In Windows, alt+tab lets you cycle through all open programs, regardless of their minimized status. And the new Win+tab feature (that mimics <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mission_Control_(OS_X)">Mission Control</a>) functions the same way.</p> </div> </div> </div></div><div class=panel><div class=panel-heading><h2 class=panel-title>Section 6: General Features</h2><p></p></div><div class=panel-body><div class="row font-rendering"> <div class=vs-score> <img class=icon-dichomoty src="../../assets/images/icon-check-circle.svg" alt="Good thing"/> <img class=logo-os src="../../assets/images/logo-apple.svg" alt=Osx /> </div> <div class="vs-description without-image"> <strong>Font rendering</strong> <p>From a designer/typography perspective, ClearType is a joke when compared to OS X's font rendering. Typography looks far sexier on OS X, with or without a retina display. Though, as others have pointed out, reading text for any period of time is easier on the eyes in Windows.</p> </div> </div> <div class="row remote-desktop-protocol"> <div class=vs-score> <img class=icon-dichomoty src="../../assets/images/icon-check-circle.svg" alt="Good thing"/> <img class=logo-os src="../../assets/images/logo-windows-10.svg" alt=Windows /> </div> <div class="vs-description without-image"> <strong>Remote desktop protocol</strong> <p>I can use the built-in RDP feature of Windows to hop into another Windows computer with full mouse and keyboard abilities. This supports multiple monitors, audio, and even the clipboard.</p> </div> </div> <div class="row system-wide-dictionary"> <div class=vs-score> <img class=icon-dichomoty src="../../assets/images/icon-check-circle.svg" alt="Good thing"/> <img class=logo-os src="../../assets/images/logo-apple.svg" alt=Osx /> </div> <div class="vs-description without-image"> <strong>System-wide dictionary</strong> <p>The built-in dictionary doesn't save my life or anything, but it was nice having it built into context menus of various programs when highlighting text. Sort of like the browser feature where you can highlight a word, then you get "Search Google for thisword" in the context menu.</p> </div> </div> <div class="row font-book"> <div class=vs-score> <img class=icon-dichomoty src="../../assets/images/icon-check-circle.svg" alt="Good thing"/> <img class=logo-os src="../../assets/images/logo-apple.svg" alt=Osx /> </div> <div class="vs-description without-image"> <strong>Font Book</strong> <p>OS X comes with Font Book, which is a great way to view and organize fonts by style.
