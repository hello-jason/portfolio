        The Club at LSU Union Square is a fine dining restaurant on Louisiana State University’s campus. I was provided with a beautiful photograph of the building’s exterior at sunset, which inspired a simplistic, left aligned and semitransparent site that spotlights the building and the food.
        
        A custom WordPress theme and plugins helps staff keep the website updated with new menu items and specials on a weekly basis.
