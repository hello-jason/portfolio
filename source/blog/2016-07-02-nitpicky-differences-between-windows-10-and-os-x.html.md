I was the only student in my graduating class in LSU's School of Art who did all my projects on a Dell. I grew up with Windows, and I have been extremely comfortable with it.

WP Engine issued me a brand new Macbook Pro when they hired me, and I spent 7 interesting months getting to know the intricacies of OS X.

## File Explorer

### Windows

  * Copy as path
  * Address bar with full path
  * Folder/file manipulation from any save/open dialog (huge!)
  * Create files from context menu (huge!)
  * Shift+click a bunch of fonts, right click, install. On OSX, you have to open font book, then drag them in.

### OSX

  * File previews for PSD, AI, etc. (good)
  * Allows multiple tabs (good)
  * Cover flow view that shows columns as you drill down is nice, but tough to get back to the top level when you’re far down (meh)
  * Cannot cut folder or file (bad)
  * Spacebar preview (good)
  * Right-click, Get info on multiple files will open an Info window for each file individually (bad, terrible, wicked). Windows, however, shows a single Properties window with combined totals for the data (good).

## Keyboard

### Windows

  * Home/End keys work like they should
  * Windows+L to lock (good)

### OSX

  * In general, keyboard shortcuts are obscure and difficult to pull off. I could be biased though. Ctrl+Shift+Eject to lock, CMD+Shift+3 to screenshot

## User Interface

### Windows

  * Windows snapping
  * Spaces
  * Each app has its own menu bar
  * Multi-monitor support
  *
    * Windows can span multiple monitors
    * Task bar on every monitor, settings to show where apps are open

### OSX

  * Clicking an app eats the first click (bad)
  * Closing apps (CMD+Q)
  * Difficult to grab window corners for resizing (bad)
  * Difficult telling titlebar’s apart (bad)
  * Windows cannot span multiple monitors (bad)
  * Does not know about additional monitors until after user logs in (bad)
  * 3rd party keyboard and mouse support BLOWS before user has logged in (bad)

## Dock/Taskbar

### Windows taskbar

  * Sneak peek view
  * Recently opened items
  * Jump lists, with pinning feature (huge!)
  *

### OSX Dock

  * Cannot have dock on all monitors (bad)
  * Clicking an icon in the dock does not maximize/minimize that application (bad)
  * Minimizing an application tosses it to the right side of the dock and kills ability to alt+tab to maximize that app (bad)

## Features

### Windows

  * Remote desktop protocol (huge!) - supports multimonitors, sound, users

### OSX

  * System-wide dictionary feature, very nice! But cannot add new words to the dictionary in right-click context menu. They want you to right click, go to Spelling and Grammar, then click a button terribly-labeled “Learn”. (stupid)

## Desktop

### OSX

  * Files that you drag to the desktop do not drop where you drag them. They often take it upon themselves to show up some other place on the desktop. (bad)
  * Plugged in devices show on the desktop (helpful)
