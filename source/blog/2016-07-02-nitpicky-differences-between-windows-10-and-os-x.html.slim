p I was the only student in my graduating class in LSU's School of Art who did all my projects on a Dell. I grew up with Windows, and I have been extremely comfortable with it my entire life.

p WP Engine issued me a brand new Macbook Pro when they hired me, and I spent 7 interesting months getting to know the intricacies of OS X.

p With this article, I'm going to focus on really good and really bad things, as they pertain to my workflow. Warning: Windows wins.

markdown:

  ## Dock/Taskbar

  ### Windows taskbar

    * Sneak peek view
    * Recently opened items
    * Jump lists, with pinning feature (huge!)
    *

  ### OSX Dock

    * Cannot have dock on all monitors (bad)
    * Clicking an icon in the dock does not maximize/minimize that application (bad)
    * Minimizing an application tosses it to the right side of the dock and kills ability to alt+tab to maximize that app (bad)

  ## Features

  ### Windows

    * Remote desktop protocol (huge!) - supports multimonitors, sound, users

  ### OSX

    * System-wide dictionary feature, very nice! But cannot add new words to the dictionary in right-click context menu. They want you to right click, go to Spelling and Grammar, then click a button terribly-labeled “Learn”. (stupid)

  ## Desktop

  ### OSX

    * Files that you drag to the desktop do not drop where you drag them. They often take it upon themselves to show up some other place on the desktop. (bad)
    * Plugged in devices show on the desktop (helpful)
