          # <span class="icon-downarrow"></span> About me

          I have been the only designer in a sea of developers and IT folks for much of my career, and I feel most at home in a tech-related company. I fell in love with the web back in 1998 when I built my first Geocities site, and I have never lost that desire to push my skills and learn new things.

          For me, design is not art; rather, it is the iterative process of reducing friction for users so they can accomplish some task. Assumptions are usually wrong, thus making design decisions based on data and feedback are quite beneficial.

          My design process considers the user's entire experience, which is why I learned frontend development to polish those details more efficiently. I am just as comfortable in Sublime and the command line as I am in Photoshop, and I am able to implement my own designs (the views and styles, at least). Otherwise, I have a working knowledge of the stack and can generally handle a project handoff to the development team.

          When not at a computer, I brew beer and have built a kegerator to dispense the hobby. I also like [working on cars](/blog/1967-mustang-restoration-project/), fishing, and enjoying life with [my wife, Katie](http://shitmywifedoes.com/).

      ## <span class="icon-downarrow"></span> Work Experience

      ### WP Engine <span>[2015–present]</span>

      [wpengine.com](https://wpengine.com)
      <br>
      [torquemag.io](http://torquemag.io)

      I joined WP Engine as their second in-house designer. My primary focus is to conceptualize and design web pages and graphical elements for wpengine.com, torquemag.io, email campaigns, and various other mediums that don't have pixels. I work closely with developers, marketing, and department heads to expand their outreach while championing brand guidelines and relying on CRO methodologies and A/B testing (and learning a lot in the process).

      ### Immense Networks <span>[2008–2015]</span>

      [immense.net](http://immense.net)

      Being the first web employee at a startup IT and hosting company, I gravitated towards WordPress to give small businesses an affordable CMS solution. I learned ways to let clients manage more complex layouts with custom plugins, documentation, and ongoing consulting, ultimately trying to reduce their learning curve as much as possible.

      As experienced backend developers joined the team, we became equipped to build more powerful applications. I was exposed to other frameworks and platforms such as Symfony, Ruby on Rails, Middleman (♥), and Express for Node. We began version control with Git and leveraged package managers and task runners, and I have grown comfortable with these tools.

      I had many responsibilities, including UI/UX design, front end developer, project manager, creative director, account executive, and maintenance consultant. I generally orchestrate projects from the initial consultation, to deployment, to ongoing feature releases and maintenance.

      Immense also owns and operates a very sophisticated hosting environment. I have become familiar with account management in WHM, cPanel, and Plesk, and I am no stranger to the command line.

      ### Gatorworks <span>[2007–2008]</span>

      [gatorworks.net](http://gatorworks.net)


      Worked on print designs including logos, business cards, etc. and developed core web development techniques.

      ### LSU Student Media <span>[2005–2007]</span>
      <a href="http://www.lsunow.com">lsureveille.com</a> (now LSU Now)
      <br>
      <a href="https://digbr.com">tigerweekly.com</a> (now Dig)

      Designed advertisements for campus-wide publications including the Daily Reveille newspaper, Legacy Magazine, and Tigerweekly.

      ## <span class="icon-downarrow"></span> About this website

      This website was an exploration for me. I built it with Middleman, a Ruby-based static site generator, and I learned some things in the process. Notably, it introduced me to Ruby helpers, asset management, and file optimization.

      I knew the site would be image-heavy, and only I would maintain it, so a static site made sense for its simplicity and speed. I have a manageable codebase in a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/hello-jason/portfolio "This site's source code") that leverages helpful tools like SCSS, Slim, [npm/gulp](/blog/remove-unused-css-from-middleman-before-deploying/ "How I remove unused CSS before deploying"), and [Bootstrap](/blog/how-bootstrap-helps-my-professional-workflow/ "How Bootstrap helps my professional workflow"). It is also hosted on GitHub Pages, simplifying deployments.
