    markdown:
      I was fortunate after graduating college to join a startup IT and hosting company who needed someone to build simple websites for their clients. I was essentially an in-house freelancer who did everything from scoping to building to invoicing. Larger projects eventually came, and I built out an incredible team of young developers, all of us eager to learn and do good work.

      My 7 years at that company allowed me to navigate stressful deadlines, to lead client negotiations, to be a decision maker, and even to fail sometimes from inexperienced overcommitment. I learned so much during my time there, and it allowed me to realize my particular strengths and, more importantly, my weaknesses.

      Then, WP Engine's marketing team took a chance on me, allowing me to join their Digital Experience team and help with web properties. I soon learned serenity in being surrounded by experts in sales, engineering, and project management. My team enables other marketers to build their own web experiences, supports the sales team through chat and tooling, and allows site visitors to self-serve as much as possible. My team is also a major contributor to how the brand itself is presented to the world. I am learning about story telling, optimizing for conversions, and problem solving. 

      I am a designer at heart, a strategic thinker. My professional experiences have given me a particular confidence at the intersection of UX, technology, and business objectives.

      ### WP Engine (2015&ndash;Present)

      <p class="job__role">Web Designer, Lead (Marketing Team)</p>

      I joined WP Engine as their second in-house designer. My primary focus is to conceptualize and design web pages and graphical elements for wpengine.com, torquemag.io, email campaigns, and various other mediums that don't have pixels. I work closely with developers, marketing, and department heads to expand their outreach while championing brand guidelines and relying on CRO methodologies and A/B testing (and learning a lot in the process).

      ### Immense Networks (2008&ndash;2015)

      <p class="job__role">Web Department Lead</p>

      I had many responsibilities at Immense, including UI/UX design, front end developer, project manager, and account executive. I generally orchestrated projects from the initial consultation, to deployment, to ongoing feature releases and maintenance.

      Being the first web employee at a startup IT and hosting company, I gravitated towards WordPress to give small businesses an affordable CMS solution. I learned ways to let clients manage more complex layouts with custom plugins, documentation, and ongoing consulting, ultimately trying to enable them to control their own content as much as possible.

      As experienced developers joined my team, we became equipped to build more powerful applications. I was exposed to other frameworks and platforms such as Symfony, Ruby on Rails, Middleman (â™¥), and Express for Node. We began version control with Git and leveraged package managers and task runners, and I grew comfortable with these tools.

      Immense also owns and operates a very sophisticated hosting environment. I became familiar with account management in WHM, cPanel, and Plesk, and I am no stranger to the command line.

      ### Gatorworks (2007&ndash;2008)

      <p class="job__role">Junior Designer</p>

    h2 About this website
  .section-content
    markdown:
      This website was an exploration for me. I built it with Middleman, a Ruby-based static site generator, and I learned some things in the process. Notably, it introduced me to Ruby helpers, asset management, and file optimization.

      I knew the site would be image-heavy, and only I would maintain it, so a static site made sense for its simplicity and speed. I have a manageable codebase in a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/hello-jason/portfolio "This site's source code") that leverages helpful tools like SCSS, Slim, [npm/gulp](/blog/remove-unused-css-from-middleman-before-deploying/ "How I remove unused CSS before deploying"), and [Bootstrap](/blog/how-bootstrap-helps-my-professional-workflow/ "How Bootstrap helps my professional workflow"). It is also hosted on GitHub Pages, simplifying deployments.
