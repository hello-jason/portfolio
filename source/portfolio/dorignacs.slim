      Dorignac's Food Center is a grocery store in Metairie, Louisiana. I worked collaboratively with [Wright Feigley Communications](http://wfcommunications.com/) to develop their design into a custom, responsive WordPress theme using the Roots framework. I was also allowed full creative freedom with the site's responsiveness and layout at smaller screen sizes.
