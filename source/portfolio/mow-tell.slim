    markdown:
      Mow & Tell is a successful local company with the desire to grow through the web and other marketing means. I provided ongoing consulting during the logo creation process, then worked with Dartanyon closely to design and develop a fitting web presence.

      The site is built onto WordPress with the Roots framework, allowing for a beautifully responsive and simple to manage website.
