    markdown:
      Gator Millworks fabricates incredible cabinets and woodcases, but their existing web presence does not reflect this tastefully.

      I have proposed and designed a large format website with beautiful photography from [Chad Chenier](http://www.chadchenierphotography.com/) that showcases the quality and craftsmanship Gator Millworks has strived to achieve since 1995. I also designed a new logo based on the company's old one.

      This project is currently under development.
