    markdown:
      Contact Mover for iOS offers a very simplistic interface to transfer contacts from one account to another, including Microsoft Exchange, iCloud, Gmail, Yahoo!, and the local address book.

      I designed the app's logo and complete user experience, deciding that a simple step-by-step wizard would adequately guide users through the process.

      Users can choose which contacts to copy to the new account, then initiate the transfer once satisfied. The app will verify that each contact is valid before transferring.
