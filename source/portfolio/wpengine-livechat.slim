      h2 What I Learned

      p I welcomed insight from Immense's IT team to help me fully understand Contact Mover's purpose.

      p I learned the importance of appropriately allocating resources when building a new product that could fail.

      p We created Contact Mover to solve a specific internal problem in mid 2011, and that evolved into a more realized solution that continuously helps hundreds of people each month now in 2015.

      p It was an iterative process that initially stressed utilitarian functionality above all else. That foundation allowed me to explore simple avenues to achieve new goals while remaining loyal to the productâ€™s legacy.
