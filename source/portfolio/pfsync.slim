    markdown:
      pfsync is a web-based application that allows Microsoft Exchange public folders natively on mobile devices. It sits between the phone and Exchange server, acting as a gateway to data that a phone cannot natively access.

      The public website will be a static site (generated by Middleman) with a backend account manager and payment portal for users.

      Important features are clearly explained and graphically represented, and content is structured to appeal to IT administrators (the productâ€™s target audience).
