    markdown:
      pfsync is a web-based application that allows Microsoft Exchange public folders natively on mobile devices. It sits between the phone and Exchange server, acting as a gateway to data that a phone cannot natively access.

      The public website will be a static site (generated by Middleman) with a backend account manager and payment portal for users.

      Important features are clearly explained and graphically represented, and content is structured to appeal to IT administrators (the productâ€™s target audience).

      I designed and developed the frontend and account management areas application, which is waiting to be hooked up to a Node.js backend. Links are below.
