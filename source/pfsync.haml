      pfsync is a web-based application that allows Microsoft Exchange public folders natively on mobile devices. It sits between the phone and Exchange server, acting as a gateway to data that a phone cannot natively access.

      The public website will be a static site (generated by Middleman) with a backend account manager and payment portal for users.
