    h2.section__title Business case
    p WP Engine has prioritized and cultivated an Agency Partner Program in an effort to support a massive customer base with exponential revenue growth attached to it. This documentary caters to that audience, tells their story, and celebrates their contribution to how the internet shapes and responds to consumers in realtime.

    p The make|SHIFT documentary focuses on a portion of that community, the creators who worked with large brands in the early days of the internet to figure out how to use a new technology to reach new audiences, new consumers.  It tells the story of how we went from banner ads and popups to magically interactive experiences like Burger&nbsp;King's Subservient Chicken.

    p A primary goal of the documentary site was lead generation. Users would have to provide some contact information via a web form, then we would email them a link to watch the video.

    p This documentary site was built on WordPress, like most of our other marketing sites, and we already had a custom HubSpot integration that accepted form submissions.
