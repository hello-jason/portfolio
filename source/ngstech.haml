      The biannual NGSTech Conference required an updatable, informative website as well as a proper online registration and payment system.
      
      After designing the 2 interfaces, I developed the public site into a custom, responsive WordPress theme while Chris McKnight developed the registration component onto Node with PayPal API integration.
      
      The project's inaugural use was very successful, and they intend to continue feature development for the next conference.

      %p WordPress allows the client to update page content and image galleries after each event.

      %p I leveraged the Roots framework and Bootstrap for solid, mobile-first responsiveness.
