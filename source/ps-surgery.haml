      ## <span>Project Details</span>
      The P&amp;S Surgical Hospital of Monroe needed a new public website to represent their evolving organization. The previous website and company representatives provided helpful feedback and content structure, allowing for a pleasant design and development process.

      The client requested a WordPress website, which would provide a comfortable platform for managing content. I designed and helped develop a responsive theme on the Roots framework, utilizing Pods (and other tools) to present the team with a small learning curve for managing their new website.
