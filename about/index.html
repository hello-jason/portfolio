I was essentially an in-house freelancer who did everything from scoping to developing to invoicing. Larger projects eventually came, and I built out an incredible team of young developers, all of us eager to learn and do good work.</p> <p>I learned so much during my 7 years at that company; navigating stressful deadlines, leading client negotiations, making decisions, and even failing sometimes from inexperienced overcommitment.</p> <p>Then, WP Engine took a chance on me, allowing me to join their Digital Experience team and help maintain their online properties. My team enables other marketers to build their own web pages for campaigns, supports the sales team through chat and tooling, and encourages customers to self-serve as much as possible. My team is also a major contributor to how the brand itself is presented to the world. I am learning about storytelling, optimizing for conversions, and problem solving.</p> <p>I am a strategic thinker with technical experience and a passion for creative solutions. I work well as a liaison between what’s important for stakeholders, what’s right for users, and what’s realistic for developers.</p> <p><strong>Hello, I&#39;m Jason.</strong></p> </div></section><section class=row><div class=section-heading></div><div class=section-content><hr/></div></section><section class=row><div class=section-heading><h2>Employment</h2></div><div class=section-content><h3>WP Engine (2015&ndash;Present)</h3> <p class=job__role>Manager, Web Design Team (Storefront Marketing)</p> <ul> <li>Player-coach serving as mentor and leader to a growth-minded design team.</li> <li>Responsible for scoping projects that support business objectives, including customer acquisition and lead generation.</li> <li>Collaborate with teams across SMB, Enterprise, and Corporate Marketing business units.</li> <li>Continuation of roles as team lead (below).</li> </ul> <p class=job__role>Lead Web Designer (Marketing)</p> <ul> <li>Designed and delivered high fidelity experience prototypes to development team.</li> <li>Created and maintained a design system used across 30+ public-facing websites.</li> <li>Founding member of Conversion Rate Optimization team, which formalized a testing strategy driven by engagement data.</li> <li>Established team cadences and processes.

I built it with Middleman, a Ruby-based static site generator, and I learned some things in the process. Notably, it introduced me to Ruby helpers, asset management, and file optimization.</p> <p>I knew the site would be image-heavy, and only I would maintain it, so a static site made sense for its simplicity and speed. I have a manageable codebase in a <a href="https://github.com/hello-jason/portfolio" title="This site's source code">GitHub repository</a> that leverages helpful tools like SCSS, Slim, <a href="/blog/remove-unused-css-from-middleman-before-deploying/" title="How I remove unused CSS before deploying">npm/gulp</a>, and <a href="/blog/how-bootstrap-helps-my-professional-workflow/" title="How Bootstrap helps my professional workflow">Bootstrap</a>. It is also hosted on GitHub Pages, simplifying deployments.</p> </div></section></main><footer id=footer></footer><script src="//assets.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js" async=true></script>
