We explored all sorts of ideas, from particle effects in <a href="https://threejs.org/" rel=nofollow>three.js</a> to the playfulness of how <a href="https://max.adobe.com/" rel=nofollow>Adobe Max</a> recreates their logo in dry ice and ink experiments.</p><p>But since time and budget were a factor, I explored an inexpensive piece of software called <a href="https://plotaverse.com/" rel=nofollow>Plotagraph</a>, which lets you give life to still images. Most of the example artwork on their site is painfully overdone, but I was able to apply it to a powder-burst version of the WP&nbsp;Engine logomark that I created to give it some feeling of awe.</p><div class="powder-container media-responsive"><img src="../../assets/images/projects/wpengine-dxp/powder-plotagraph.jpg" class="media-responsive powder-image" alt="Powder plotagraph"/><video autoplay=1 class="powder-video media-responsive" loop=1 playsinline=1 poster="../../assets/videos/logo-poof.jpg" preload=none><source src="../../assets/videos/logo-poof.mp4" type="video/mp4"/><source src="../../assets/videos/logo-poof.webm" type="video/webm"/></video></div><p>After launch, the average time of existing customers who visit the home page to log into their account increased a bit, likely meaning that they stopped to gaze at my creation; UX speed bump, but selfishly rewarding.</p></div></section><section class="primary-navigation odd"><div class=content><h2 class=section__title>Primary navigation</h2><p>My typical workflow in the past was to design the navigation first, which would inspire the rest of the process. But this project was different; the navigation was one of the last components I worked on.</p><p>Although we mostly finalized our navigation's structure months earlier, I had to push those wireframes into something that felt complete, something representative of the brand. This proved challenging. It required lots of iterations with top stakeholders.</p><img src="../../assets/images/projects/wpengine-dxp/nav-exploration.jpg" class="media-responsive nav-exploration" alt="Nav exploration"/></div></section><section class=sales-chat><div class=content><h2 class=section__title>Sales chat experience</h2><p>Live chat on any website is often a high-priority lead generation pipeline for that business. I had been heavily involved in <a href="/projects/wpengine-livechat/">sales chat A/B testing</a> on wpengine.com, so I explored how to integrate that channel into the new website experience.</p><p>I built onto past learnings from our testing and made the live chat experience noticeable and engaging. The chat pops into view a few seconds after the page has fully loaded, so you're more likely to notice it, accompanied by a quick bloop sound. We randomize photos of actual WP&nbsp;Engine sales employees, and a red notification bubble indicates you have an unread message.</p><img src="../../assets/images/projects/wpengine-dxp/nav-chat-notification.gif" class=media-responsive alt="Nav chat notification"/><p>A variant of this experience can be applied to buttons. Clicking the button will reveal the same employee's face from above, but we build anticipation with an animation mimicking typing, followed by a nice message. Clicking <em>reply</em> triggers a chat with someone in sales, so the experience is natural for potential customers.</p><img src="../../assets/images/projects/wpengine-dxp/specialist-popup.gif" class=media-responsive alt="Specialist popup"/><p>I designed the entire situation to trigger typical human impulses, hopefully in a respectful way, in order to increase engagement. It has been effective.</p></div></section><section class="pricing-components odd"><div class=content><h2 class=section__title>Pricing components</h2><p>These components are often how users convert into customers on the website. They are a big deal. Like with sales chat, I had been heavily involved in previous explorations to increase unassisted signups and <abbr title="average revenue per customer">ARPU</abbr> through these pricing components, so I applied past lessons here to minimize conversion loss.</p><img src="../../assets/images/projects/wpengine-dxp/component-plans-table.gif" class="media-responsive component-plans-table" alt="Component plans table"/></div></section><section class=profile-builder><div class=content><h2 class=section__title>Profile builder form</h2><p>The profile builder form is the first outward-facing component of our personalization engine. Users who complete the form are rewarded with customized content and messaging throughout the website. I worked with a developer to make it enticing and fun, and we are seeing user engagement. This initial version of the form will be improved over time.</p><img src="../../assets/images/projects/wpengine-dxp/p13n-form.gif" class="media-responsive p13n-form" alt="P13n form"/></div></section><section class="component-system odd"><div class=content><h2 class=section__title>Component-based design system</h2><p>We created a series of <em>web components</em> for different types of content, which complement each other when used in various configurations. Our developers integrated this component system into a page builder plugin for WordPress called <a href="https://www.wpbeaverbuilder.com/" rel=nofollow>Beaver Builder</a>. This is the foundation that allows us to quickly build new web pages that are on brand.</p><img src="../../assets/images/projects/wpengine-dxp/documentation-components.gif" class="media-responsive doc-components" alt="Documentation components"/><h3>How new pages are built</h3><p>New pages often begin with the stakeholder and copywriter hashing out the overall story. The copywriter then fits that story into our design components within a Google Doc. Once done, the copywriter hands over that Google Doc with their content broken down into the design component sections. A designer then builds the page directly in WordPress by dragging in the Beaver Builder components and applying the text as needed. Often no need for developer intervention at all.</p><ol class=big-list><li><span class=number>»</span> <span class=text>Copywriter &rarr; Designer &rarr; Stakeholder approval &rarr; <strong>Published</strong></span></li></ol><img src="../../assets/images/projects/wpengine-dxp/documentation-bbdemo.gif" class="media-responsive doc-bbdemo" alt="Documentation bbdemo"/><h3>Improving the process</h3><p>To improve this process further, I have begun training other teams how to build their own pages. I documented our design system with pictures, step-by-step guides, and pro-tips for finding approved images and so forth. We created custom WordPress user roles so they can log in and see only what they need to see.</p><p>Other teams are beginning to build their own pages and submit them for review. A designer reviews their page and publishes it for them. This shift in workload results in pages getting out faster, and it allows my team to make the page builder tools more friendly and to create more engaging experiences elsewhere on the site.</p><img src="../../assets/images/projects/wpengine-dxp/documentation-guide.gif" class="media-responsive doc-guide" alt="Documentation guide"/></div></section><section class=what-i-learned><div class=content><h2 class=section__title>What I learned</h2><p>I had never collaborated with so many professionals on a project before. The experience was humbling, exciting, and even frustrating at times. I learned to break out of the designer's mindset that cherishes pixels, and instead speak for the user during early phases and throughout the entire production. I found a place at the table that allowed me to oversee and execute the collision of business objectives and user delight.</p><p>I'm happy with the project. And while I cannot detail ongoing marketing efforts for the website, it is of course an ever-evolving thing.</p></div></section><section class=awards><div class=content><h2 class=section__title>Awards</h2><ol class=big-list><li> <span class=number>🏆</span> <span class=text>2019 dotCOMM Awards, Gold - B2B Website</span></li><li> <span class=number>🏆</span> <span class=text>2018 WebAward - Outstanding Website</span></li></ol></div></section><section class="check-it-out odd"><div class=content><h2 class=section__title>Check it out</h2><div class=col-md-6><a class=btn href="https://wpengine.com/">Visit the website</a></div><div class=col-md-6><a class=btn href="https://wpengine.com/wp-engine-case-study/">Official case study</a></div></div></section></main><footer id=footer></footer><script src="//assets.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js" async=true></script>
